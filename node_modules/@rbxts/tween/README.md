# Tween
A library for writing efficient, simple interpolation code.

Setup:
```ts
import { Standard, Deceleration, OutElastic } from "@rbxts/easing-functions";
import Tween from "@rbxts/tween";

const Workspace = game.GetService("Workspace");
```

Here is the generalized form:

```ts
/**
 * Creates a Tween along a curve, with a callback to call each tick.
 * Connects an interpolation function to RunService.RenderStepped if initialValue is a CFrame,
 * else RunService.Heartbeat.
 * @param totalDuration The total duration of the Tween
 * @param easingFunction The easingFunction to call each tick
 * @param callback The function to call each tick
 * @param initialValue The starting value to interpolate to push into the callback function each tick. default=0
 * @param endValue The target value the initialValue should reach. default=1
 * @param extraValue1 An extra value to be passed into the easingFunction
 * @param extraValue2 An extra value to be passed into the easingFunction
 */
declare function Tween<T extends LerpableTypes = number>(
	totalDuration: number,
	easingFunction: (delta: T) => void,
	callback: (delta: T) => void,
	initialValue?: T,
	endValue?: T,
	extraValue1?: any,
	extraValue2?: any,
): PseudoTween;
```

Here is the simplest form:

This will return a Tween object, and connect this interpolation to RunService.Heartbeat. x will be a number along the Standard curve [0, 1]. The interpolation will last 1 second. Standard is the EasingFunction, which is the curve along which this interpolation will animate.
```ts
Tween(1, Standard, x => print(x));
```

Functions that interpolate CFrames will instead connect to RunService.RenderStepped.
```ts
const Camera = Workspace.CurrentCamera;
const StartPosition = Camera.CFrame;
const EndPosition = Camera.CFrame.add(new CFrame(5, 5, 5));

// binds to RenderStepped
Tween(2, Deceleration, Position => Camera.CFrame = Position, StartPosition, EndPosition);
```

StartPosition and EndPosition can be basically any Roblox type (default = number), and this will be the type that gets passed into the callback.
```ts
const red = Color3.fromRGB(255, 0, 0);
const blue = Color3.fromRGB(0, 0, 255);
const myObj = new Instance("Part");
myObj.Parent = Workspace

// The last two 0.5 arguments will be passed into OutElastic, as parameters representing amplitude and period
Tween(1, OutElastic, x => print(x), myObj.Color, blue, 0.5, 0.5)
```

When lerping Color3 values, it will automatically lerp across the CIELUV Color space:

## PseudoTween Object

Calling the Tween function will return a PseudoTween, which has pretty much the same API as Roblox's TweenBase.

```ts
/**
 * A Tween Object
 */
interface PseudoTween {
	/**
	 * The Play function starts the playback of its Tween.
	 * Note: if a tween has already begun calling Play,
	 * this will have no effect unless the tween has finished or has been stopped
	 * (either by this.Cancel() or this.Pause()).
	 */
	Resume(): this;

	/**
	 * The Pause function halts playback of its Tween.
	 * If TweenBase/Resume is called again the tween will resume playback from the moment it was paused.
	 */
	Pause(): this;

	/**
	 * The Cancel function halts playback of its Tween and resets the tween variables.
	 * If TweenBase:Play is called again the Tween's properties will resume interpolating towards their destination but,
	 * as the tween variables have been reset, take the full length of the animation to do so.
	 */
	Cancel(): this;

	/**
	 * Yields the current thread until the Tween has completed.
	 */
	Wait(): this;
}
```
